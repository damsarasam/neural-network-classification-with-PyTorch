   - Generates synthetic data using `make_circles` function from `sklearn.datasets`.
   - Builds and trains a neural network model for binary classification.
   - Evaluates the model's performance on test data.
   - Visualizes decision boundaries and predictions.

2. **Regression with Neural Networks**:
   - Generates synthetic data for a linear regression problem.
   - Constructs and trains a neural network model to perform regression.
   - Evaluates the model's performance on test data.
   - Plots predictions against ground truth data.

3. **Model Architectures**:
   - Provides two different neural network architectures: one using explicit layer definitions and the other using `nn.Sequential`.
   - Demonstrates the usage of various activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

4. **Training and Evaluation**:
